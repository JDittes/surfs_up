Practice with SQLite

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
My dream is to open a Surf & Shake Shop on Oahu, so I can spend the rest of my life surfing and, well, sipping shakes (sometimes even slurping them). A key investor named W. Avy has come on board, but he wants more than the business analysis I have prepared: he wants a weather analysis of Oahu. He's worried that too much rain will chase away surfers along with any appetite for milkshakes.

I want to create a progrm that analyses data from a SQLite database that Mr. Avy has set up. I will use dependencies from SQLAlchemy to help python interact with the code. Then I will set up a web site using Flask to let Mr. Avy interact with the data and find answers to his questions about rain

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
